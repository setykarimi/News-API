# News API Project

Hi guysüëã,
Im sety and this is my News project. 
I've used [newsapi.org] content for my home page, but I set them in my db.json file, because we have admin for adding custom news.
You can login to admin panel => userName: sety, Pasword: 123456.
If you wanna set your NAME you have to change my name in Login page.
Hope you enjoy it‚ù§Ô∏è!

Dont Forget  `npm install` üòä
